This project was created by group C03 for the second year Systems Design course of the bachelor program at the faculty of Aerospace Engineering at TU Delft.

This project was created to find viable design options for the thermal control system of a Venus orbiter, mainly values for absorptance and emmittance of the spacecraft, as well as radiator surface area and heater power
in order to keep the temperature of the spacecraft at an acceptable value. It can be used to check what design options get you within a certain range of temperatures, and what design options get you near a target temperature.

The file ThermalControl.py contains the python code for this project. The csv files contain some example output, and the png figure contains a visual presentation of the viable design points that result in an equal sunlit and eclipse temperature of 15 degrees Celsius. It plots for all design points the radiator area [mÂ²] they require as well as the heater power [W].
